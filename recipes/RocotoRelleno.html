        <ol>
            <li>We begin by cutting a cap off the hot peppers, remove the veins and seeds trying not to break them, wash and boil it 2 times (for 3 minutes) in salted water, changing it each time.</li>
            <li>In the third time we boil in water with sugar, then place them and let them drain well.</li>
            <li>Chop the onion into cubes, fry it in three tablespoons of oil; when it begins to brown, season with salt and cumin, mix and add the ground meat, stirring it with a wooden spatula.</li>
            <li>Then, we fry a few minutes until the meat changes color. Season with oregano, salt and pepper to taste, cook for a few more minutes.</li>
            <li>Later, we add the chopped parsley, stir well and add the olives and chopped eggs. Mix and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>With the preparation of the filling already ready, we proceed to fill the hot peppers and place them in a baking dish, cover the hot peppers with a slice of cheese and place the lid that was removed at the beginning. Next to the hot peppers we place the peeled potatoes, sprinkle the hot peppers and potatoes with milk and then put them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
