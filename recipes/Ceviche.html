    <p>If we have to talk about a representative dish of Peruvian gastronomy, the name that automatically comes to mind is ceviche. A couple of examples perfectly illustrate the importance of this food in the South American country. In 2004, ceviche was declared by the National Institute of Culture (INC) as Cultural Heritage of the Nation, considering it one of the main dishes of Peru.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook the slices of choclo (corn) until they are cooked, with a few grains of anise to flavor it.</li>
            <li>Similarly, we cook the sweet potatoes, peel them and cut them into slices of about 2 centimeters.</li>
            <li>We wash the fish well with water and salt and cut it into squares according to taste. The usual thing is to make them between 1 and 2 centimeters.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion to the feather (cut very similar to the julienne, very thin and always taking advantage of the length of the onion, never across). - We put the fish in a bowl and season it with the crushed garlic. Add the very finely chopped aj√≠ limo, the juice of the freshly squeezed lemons, the pepper and the chopped coriander. Let rest for a minimum of 10 minutes (to taste, if you want the fish to be more marinated, you can increase the time).</li>
            <li>Finally, we place the onion on top of the fish, and garnish the dish with the corn, chili pepper in small slices, the sweet potato and the lettuce.</li>
        </ol>
